    <h2>FEBE</h2>
    <p>During my PhD I developed a hybrid approach that couples Finite Element Method with Boundary Element Method, hence the name FEBE, to study long term evolution of fault zones. The implementation is aimed at improving the computational efficiency of large scale earthquake models that are usually intractible while accounting for high resolution fault zone physics such as material heterogenity, inelastic response, and fluid diffusion.  </p>

    <h2>High Resolution Fault Zone Physics</h2>
    <p>Through the development of FEBE we were able to model the evolution of fault zone with high resolution physics based on observations. This includes modeling fault zones with pre-existing, such as low velocity fault zones, and evolving damage, such as plasticity. By incorporating these physical mechanism we are able to better understand the interactions, or what we call coevolution, between surrounding fault zone and principal slip surfaces.  </p>
