Welcome! My name is Mohamed Abdelmeguid, I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar at Caltech GALCIT. I obtained my PhD from Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. My research focuses on utilizing experimental, theoretical and computational mechanics to study dynamic failure, and wave propagation during frictional sliding. My interests span a wide range of topics, including multi-physics and multi-scale modeling, fault zone physics, experimental analysis of dynamic fracture, wave propagation in solids, computational fluid dynamics, and structural analysis. My main work objective is to develop physics-based models to understand the intricies of dynamic failure within natural and engineered systems. Currently my work is has applications in geophysics, seismology, and structural engineering.
